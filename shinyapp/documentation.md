# Next word predictor

This Shiny application predicts the next words of the next you are typing.

Based on the analysis of a large corpora of texts extracted from internet blogs, 
news pages and twitter, it calculates the most probable set of words that might 
follow the sentence you have typed so far.

The application also allows you to adjust how many words do you want to be suggested 
(from 1 to 10). The suggestions will be made in descending order of probability.

Clicking on any of the suggested words, it is added to the typed text, and the  
suggestions are updated according to the new sentence.
